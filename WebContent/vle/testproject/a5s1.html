<p class="center" id="audio5">In just this short time, the code we ended up with got somewhat complicated.<br> 
Next time, we'll start looking into how to use <span class="vocab">helper methods</span> 
to make the <tt>VirtualPet</tt> class much more manageable.  
After that, we'll consider ways to do careful testing that will allow you to add changes without introducing new bugs. 
Eventually, you'll spend a few days with free rein to make your own virtual pet toy.  The crazier you can make it the better! It's for kids to play with, after all.  </p>

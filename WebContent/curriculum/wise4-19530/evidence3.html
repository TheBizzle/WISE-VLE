<b>Look at the following statistics on airbags, courtesy of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  Pay attention to who is at high risk in collisions involving airbags.</b>
</P>

<br>
<br>

       <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that <b>airbags have saved the lives of more than 15,000 people</b>.
      <br><BR>
       However, from 1990 to 2004, 246 deaths reportedly have been caused by airbags inflating in <b>low severity crashes</b>. These deaths include 85 drivers, 11 adult non-drivers, 127 children, and 23 infants.
<br><BR>
        Of the 85 drivers killed by airbags, <b>64 were female, 21 were male.  58 were unbelted or improperly belted, and 24 were belted</b>.
<br><BR>
        Of the 11 adult non-drivers killed by passenger airbags, <b>9 were females and 2 were males</b>. 7 were unbelted or improperly belted, and 4 were belted.
<br><BR>
        Of the 127 children killed by passenger airbags, <b>122 were unbelted or improperly belted, and 5 were belted</b>.
<br><BR>
        Starting with the 1998 model year, airbags typically deploy with less speed.  Driver death rates are estimated to be 6 percent lower in 1998 and 1999 model passenger vehicles, compared with 1997 models.</p>

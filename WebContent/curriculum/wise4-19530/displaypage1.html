In this activity you will use a more complex simulation to analyze the interaction between the airbag and the driver in a crash.  <b>You will be able to experiment with the driver's POSITION, VELOCITY, and DELAY TIME to address the following questions:</b>

<ul>
<li><p>How does the <B>position vs. time graph tell you</b> whether the driver might have been harmed by the airbag?
<li><p>How does the <b>velocity vs. time graph tell you</b> whether the driver might have been harmed by the airbag?
<li><p>Why are <b>shorter drivers at greater risk</b> for harm from an airbag than taller drivers?
<li><p>Is a driver more likely to be harmed by an airbag in a <b>high speed or low speed collision</b>?
<li><p>How does the car's <b>ability to "crumple"</b> during a crash help prevent a driver from being harmed by an airbag?
</ul>
<p><b><font color="green">Recall that the greatest risk for harm from an airbag comes from the driver striking an airbag that has not completely inflated.</font></b>  Record your thoughts on these questions in the next step.

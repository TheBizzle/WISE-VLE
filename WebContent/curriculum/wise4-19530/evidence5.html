<p>As we saw before, engineers do crash tests to analyze the results from car crashes.  Engineers also use <B>computer simulations</B> to see what might happen in a crash.</p>
<BR>
<p>Here is an example of a simulation created by engineers at <b>Applied Research Associates (http://www.ara.com)</b>.  These engineers took apart a real car bolt by bolt and constructed it on the computer to help them see what the car would do in a head-on collision.</p>

<p>In this investigation, we will also use some simple computer simulations to help us understand what happens in a car crash.  These simulations will help us  figure out how to keep people safe in collisions.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Your investigation will culminate in a report to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), summarizing <font color="green"> how cars and airbags should be designed to minimize the risk of harm to the driver.</font></b></p>

<p>In the previous activity, you learned about how the elements in the two different kinds of processes have very different ways of interacting.  In order to understand a process deeply, not only must we describe the pattern and its elements, we have to understand <em>HOW</em> the pattern is produced from the interactions of the elements. This is called the <em>mechanism</em> of the process, and it has to do with the relationship between two levels of description that we call the "micro" level and the "macro" level.</p>
<p>Let's start by explaining what we mean by the word "levels".  This word could refer to the actual, physical <em>levels</em> of something -- like the levels of a cake or the floors of a building. Or, the word could refer to <em>levels</em> of experience or sophistication, like the levels of a video game - when you move up to the "next level". Finally, there can be <em>levels of detail</em>, like the "overview" level, or the "nitty gritty level".</p>
<p>You've probably heard the terms "micro" and "macro" before, but we should also say a bit about how we will use those terms. <em>Micro</em> does not always have to mean "microscopic", but does always refers to a low level of detail.  <em>Macro</em>, on the other hand, is typically used to describe the most visible level, or pattern level of a process or object.</p>
<p>But how do we decide what is the micro and macro level of a process?  For the purposes of this lesson, we will define the <em>micro level</em> as the level of the elements, and the macro level as the level of the pattern.  In the next few pages, we'll show you that it is the <em>relationships between</em> the micro and macro levels of a process that really define whether it is a direct or emergent process.</p>

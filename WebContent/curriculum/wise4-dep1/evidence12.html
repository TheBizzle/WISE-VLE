<p>Earlier, we said that students tend to assume that emergent processes are like direct processes. This is partly because most students have never heard of an emergent process. But it is also because engineering and science textbooks tend to describe emergent processes in direct terms, making it sound like the pattern or outcome is the underlying cause. For example, most textbook descriptions of diffusion say that molecules tend to move from high to low concentration, or travel down concentration gradients, or spread until equilibrium is reached. Statements like these describe what happens during diffusion, but they don't explain <i>why</i> it happens. To understand why diffusion occurs, we need to examine the macro and and micro levels, then try to figure out how the micro-level interactions produce the macro-level outcome.</p> 
<p><strong>Macro Level</strong><br />
What is the outcome of diffusion? What changes lead to that outcome? When you add blue dye to water, one area is initially dark blue and the rest is clear. Over time, the color gradually spreads until all the liquid is uniformly light blue in color. From that point on, nothing appears to move or change. The outcome is equilibrium, and the changes are the gradual spreading and mixing of substances.</p> 
<p><strong>Micro Level</strong><br />
What are the agents that produce the outcome? How do they behave and interact? The agents are the molecules of the diffusing substances. In the dye-and-water example, all the dye and water molecules move continuously in random directions. They are all doing the same thing, so their behaviors are <strong>uniform</strong>. They are all acting at the same time, so their behaviors are <strong>simultaneous</strong>. Any molecule can collide with any nearby molecule, so their interactions are <strong>random</strong>. Molecular behaviors are not affected by what happens to other molecules, so they are <strong>independent</strong>, and the molecules continue to move randomly after equilibrium is reached, so behaviors are <strong>continuous</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Inter Level</strong><br />
How do the micro-level interactions produce the macro-level outcome? First, the dye-and-water molecules are not deliberately trying to achieve equilibrium. They move continuously in random directions simply because that's what fluid molecules do. In the process, they achieve equilibrium, but the outcome is <strong>unintentional</strong>. Second, the behaviors and outcome are often <strong>unmatched</strong>. Because fluid molecules move in random directions, each molecule is as likely to move in one direction as another. At any given moment, some dye molecules will be moving toward rather than away from other dye molecules, and some water molecules will be moving toward other water molecules.
</p>
<p>Third, all the dye and water molecules are equally important in achieving equilibrium. No molecule contributes more than any other molecule, so there are <strong>no key players</strong>. Fourth, equilibrium is produced by the entire group of molecules, but their actions are not coordinated. The group function more like a mob than a team, so the process is <strong>unorganized</strong>.
</p>
<p>Fifth, the accumulation of changes that occur during diffusion is <strong>proportional</strong> rather than additive. Equilibrium doesn't happen just because the number of dye molecules in the blue area increases. Rather, it happens because the dye-to-water ratio changes in all areas until it is even throughout the container.</p> 
<p>Sixth, diffusion is <strong>probabilistic</strong>. Imagine you have a fly trapped inside a box. It is flying all around, and you can't predict which way it will fly next. At any given moment, the chance of it being in the left half of the box is 1/2. Now imagine there are two flies, both flying randomly. If you could suddenly freeze their motion, the chance of both being in the left half is 1/4. The chance of one being in each half is 2/4. With four flies, the chance of all four being in the left half is 1/16. The chance of two flies being in each half is 8/16. As you continue to add flies, the chance of all the flies being concentrated in one area decreased rapidly. This illustrates that, in a process that involves random motion, the greatest chance is for an even distribution. In other words, diffusion occurs by chance.</p> 
<p>Regardless of what textbooks might lead you to believe, fluid molecules are not driven by concentration gradients or drawn toward equilibrium. They simply move continuously in random directions. If order emerges out of the chaos of molecular motion, it is not because the molecules work together to achieve it or because some outside force controls their movements. The outcome is unintentional. It emerges by chance.</p>

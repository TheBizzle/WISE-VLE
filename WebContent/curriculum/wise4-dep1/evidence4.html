<p>Let's think more carefully about the process of building a skyscraper.  We would like to consider this process in terms of the definition given in the previous step:  What is the pattern?  How does the pattern change?  What are the elements of the process?  What are their interactions, and how is the pattern produced?</p>

<p>What is the pattern in the process of building a skyscraper and how does it behave/change? In building the skyscraper, the pattern is the changing shape and size of the building. The building does not change in exactly the same way every day. Probably the most noticeable change at least in the beginning of the construction phase is the increasing height of the building.  In later phases of the construction, you might not notice any changes, as the workers such as the electricians install wiring, or the plumbers install the plumbing. So the observable pattern within a process may appear to be stable and unchanging.
</p>
<p>What are the elements of this process and how do they interact? The elements of this process are the workers who contribute to the building and the materials they use in their construction tasks. Each element behaves in its own way, depending on the specific job of the worker:  architects design the plan for the building; foremen oversee the construction workers; steel workers connect steel beams; electricians install wiring, and so on.</p>
<p>Notice that each type of worker interacts with another worker or some other element in a different way. The architect designs the plan, but the foremen oversee the construction workers. The electricians install wiring whereas the steel workers, like the ones in the picture above, connect steel beams. Not only does each type of worker interact differently with each other, but some workers' roles may be seen as more central than others. For example, you might say that the architect is the mastermind of the whole project. That is, the architect is the one with the overall plan, and who is responsible if the construction of the building went wrong in some way.</p>
<p>So far, in describing the process of building a skyscraper, we have talked about the pattern as sometimes changing (the building growing taller and more complete-looking), and sometimes not visibly changing. <em>But what causes the pattern to change or not to change?</em> When the pattern changes visibly (when the building is getting taller) this change is most likely caused by the steel workers who lay the beams and masons who lay the foundation. So, these groups of workers, the steel workers and the masons are directly responsible, more or less, for the building getting visibly taller. When the outer shell of the building is constructed, you might not notice any changes but the pattern of electrical wiring within the building does change every day. The electricians are the group of workers who are responsible for installing the electrical wiring within the building causing the wiring within the building to change over time even though you don't notice it. It is important to note that the different aspects of the pattern are <em>directly caused</em> by a variety of different activities or interactions of the workers. The steel workers are directly responsible for making the building taller, whereas the electricians are directly responsible for installing the wiring. Finally, the interactions among the different elements must often occur in a sequence. For example, the architect must first lay out a blueprint for the wiring; then the electricians refer to this blueprint as they install the wiring, alongside other workers who are erecting the walls and framing of the building. The foreman gives directions, and helps to coordinate all the efforts of different types of workers.</p> 
<p>One thing you might have noticed about this description is that we emphasized the phrase <em>directly caused</em>. Processes like building a skyscraper can be called <em><strong>direct processes</strong></em>, because various aspects of the pattern or patterns within the process are <em>directly caused</em> by interactions among some group of the elements. In the skyscraper example, when the building gets taller, it was directly caused by what the steel workers did, but not what the electricians were doing.</p>  
<p>Many <strong><em>Direct Processes</em></strong> are probably familiar to you, such as riding a bike, typing a paper on a computer, playing a baseball game, or walking from one place to another. In each of these processes, the observed patterns are directly caused by interactions of some of  the elements. These kinds of processes are common, and we will compare them to another important kind of process -- called an <strong><em>Emergent Process</em></strong> - where the pattern is not directly caused by any individual or groups of the elements.  Rather, the pattern is caused by the interactions of all of the elements, considered together.</p>

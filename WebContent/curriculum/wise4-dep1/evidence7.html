<p>In direct processes, the elements have clear interactions which <em>directly</em> lead to the observed pattern.  For example, when a skyscraper is built, only the architect produces a blueprint, and the quality and completeness of that blueprint can determine how well the design of the building gets communicated to the other workers.</p>
<p>In emergent processes, the overall pattern <em>emerges</em> from the behavior of all the elements, whose interactions are not necessarily directly connected to the pattern.  The pattern is not created by the actions of specific or special elements, but instead emerges as a result of all elements interacting in no particular order or sequence. When a crowd of people forms a bottleneck, the pattern is due to the accumulated effect of many elements (the individual people) interacting in similar but independent fashion (each person continuously trying to move toward the exit). The pattern emerges as a result of all the elements interacting in this fashion.</p>

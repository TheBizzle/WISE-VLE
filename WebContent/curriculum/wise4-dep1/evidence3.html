<p>Have you ever noticed that some things seem to be very similar, but are actually fundamentally different?  For example, one common mistake made by students is believing that whales are a kind of fish. Whales have some strikingly similar features to fish -- they live in the water, have tails and fins, and this is why it is easy to make the assumption that they are fish. However, fish lay eggs, breathe underwater, and have scales. In contrast, whales give birth to live offspring, breath air from the surface, and have smooth skin.  Whales are mammals, and are therefore more similar to your pet dog than to your pet fish! This is an example of how some things seem ready-made to be mis-categorized, which can lead to further conceptual problems later on.</p>

<p>Of course, placing a new object, animal or concept into a familiar category can be very helpful, since we can apply the knowledge we have about other members of that category to the new topic.  For example, if someone told us about a strange new kind of fish that lived on the ocean floor, we could still apply the things we know about fish in general to make some reasonable assumptions: The new fish breathes with gills, is cold blooded, lays eggs, and so on.  However, placing a new concept in the wrong category could actually be harmful to our understanding, since (like placing whales in the fish category) it would lead us to infer properties that are not actually true.</p>  
<p>We have noticed that certain concepts are actually prone to such mis-categorization, because they appear at first glance to be in one category but are actually in a fundamentally different one.  For engineering students, such a mistake could be quite costly! This lesson is designed to help you learn about a specific kind of science concept called an &#8220;Emergent Process&#8221; that is often mistaken by students as a more simple, direct process.  The various activities below will help you think about these subtle but important differences, and prepare you to look for this important category in your future engineering courses.</p>

<p><b>What are the elements of the process of a crowd forming a bottleneck?</b></p>
<p>The elements of the bottleneck process are the students who are crowded at the classroom exit.</p>
<p><b>How do the elements of the process behave and interact with each other? Give 2 examples.</b></p>
<p>1) The students each push and shove one another as they try to make progress toward the exit.<br>2) The students are all simultaneously trying to exit.</p>
<p><b>By what mechanism do the interactions of the elements cause the pattern?</b>
<p>The mechanism of this processes is the simultaneous action of all the students, each of whom wants the same thing: to get through the door once the bell has rung.  The fact that no students began moving to the door until the bell rang assured that a bottle neck would emerge as a result of the simultaneous but independent actions.</p>

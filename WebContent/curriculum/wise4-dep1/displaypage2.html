<p>As we learned in the previous section, both direct and emergent processes are made up of elements that interact with one another to result in a pattern.  In the case of direct processes like the skyscraper being built, the elements interact in direct, causal ways.  In the case of emergent processes like the crowd forming a bottleneck, the elements also interact, but not in any way that directly <em>causes</em> the pattern. In this section, we'll explore the interactions of elements a little more closely using the two examples of Fish and Wolves.</p>

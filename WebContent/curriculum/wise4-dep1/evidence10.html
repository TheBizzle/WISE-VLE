<p>Remember our old friends, the wolves? We learned that their hunting is a <em>direct process</em> that includes a pattern where a pack of wolves is seen to hunt and kill their prey. In the case of wolves, we saw how the pattern clearly resulted from individual animals setting the hunt in motion, with different wolves performing different functions.  In the <em>emergent process</em> of fish schooling, however, the contributions of elements (fish) to the pattern (schooling) is non-direct, resulting from the unrestricted, simultaneous, and ongoing interactions of all the fish swimming near each other.

<p>So how can we describe these two different kinds of processes in terms of the relationship between the <em>macro level</em> of the pattern, and the <em>micro level</em> of the elements? The following five statements capture this relationship. For each one, we first describe the relationship in direct processes, then contrast it with the relationship in emergent processes.</p>
<p><strong>1a.  In <em>direct processes</em>, different aspects of the pattern are caused by a specific element or different groups of elements.</strong>  Remember that different wolves have distinguishable interactions, such as the lead (or "alpha") wolf commanding the attack whereas other lower ranking wolves could be called on to chase the prey or to decoy the prey. This means that the alpha wolf might do his commanding in the beginning of the hunt, followed by the lower ranking wolves decoying the prey. After this the stronger wolves might actually move in for the kill.  The point here is that different elements (wolves) contribute to different aspects of the pattern.</p>
<p><strong>1b. In <em>emergent processes,</em> however, every aspect of the pattern is caused by the entire collection of elements at all times.</strong> The pattern of a school of fish swimming in the same direction across the ocean floor is caused by all the fish at all times. Even though some fish might be swimming slightly to the left and some others might be swimming slightly upwards, when you take all the fish together, they form a school and are swimming in a specific direction.</p>
<p><strong>2a. In <em>direct processes</em> the interactions of the elements have clear and direct effects on the overall pattern.</strong>  This means that the pattern itself can be directly traced to the interactions of specific elements. For example, in the case of the wolves, the alpha wolf actually triggers the beginning of the pattern, and the wolf who makes the kill clearly defines the end of the pattern.</p>
<p><strong>2b. In <em>emergent processes</em> however, the elements have only non-direct effects on the overall pattern.</strong>  Individual fish aren't directly causing the pattern of the school. Instead, the school emerges from the combined interactions of all the individual fish, by swimming near each other.</p>
<p><strong>3a. In <em>direct processes,</em> some elements have a more important or special contribution to the pattern than others.</strong>  In the wolf pack, not all wolves are as important to the hunting pattern. Some wolves just stand by and try to stay out of the way, or block off escape routes. Others just give chase, but don't really get involved in the killing.</p>
<p><strong>3b. In <em>emergent processes</em> however, no element of the micro level has any special connection or contribution to the pattern.</strong>   Unlike the wolf pack, the fish don't have a leader or any special kind of fish that contributes more toward forming the school.</p>
<p><strong>4a. In <em>direct processes</em>, the interactions of some of the elements match or correspond to the pattern.</strong> Because there is a clear and direct effect between the interactions of the wolves and the resulting pattern, the specific interactions of the wolves correspond directly to the pattern of the hunt. For example, if part of the macro level pattern includes the killing of the prey, then a specific wolf must directly do the killing.</p>
<p><strong>4b. In <em>emergent processes</em>, however, the interactions of the elements do not necessarily have to match the pattern.</strong> If a school of fish is heading to the right, individual fish could be swimming slightly to the left, or upwards, or downwards. So in fact, the interactions of the elements do not necessarily have to correspond or match the behavior of the pattern.</p>
<p><strong>5a. In <em>direct processes</em>, some of the elements may have a specific, intentional purpose of causing the pattern.</strong>  For example, in the case of the wolf hunt, the alpha wolf actually coordinates the wolf pack, setting up the intention to hunt.</p>
<p><strong>5b. In <em>emergent processes</em>, however, no element has the purpose of actually causing the pattern.</strong> The fish aren't specifically trying to cause the school pattern, as if to say, "Hey I have an idea:  let's form a school to protect ourselves...".  Instead they are simply trying to stay near to their neighbors, and the school emerges from the combined effect of all their individual interactions.</p>

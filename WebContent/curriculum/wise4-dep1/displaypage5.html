<p>The picture below is a screen shot form the computer model that will launch when you click on the next step. The simulation depicts a macro-level view of diffusion. The macro level is the surface view, consisting of changes one can observe with the naked eye. You will also explore a micro-level simulation that will provide a deeper view, enabling you to see how diffusing molecules behave and interact.</p> 
<p>The large rectangle in the middle of the screen is a container with two sides. The left side contains water and the right side contains blue dye. The wall between the two sides has a gate that will open when you click <strong>Start</strong> and close when you click <strong>Pause</strong>. During the simulation, you can click <strong>Reset</strong> to return the dye and the water to their original sides, and you can use the levers to adjust the size of the gate and the concentration of the dye. The numbers beneath the container indicate the amount of water and dye on each side, and the box on the left will track the time as the simulation runs.</p>

<p>To make sure you see what the model is intended to show, we have provided some instructions to follow and questions to answer as you explore the simulation. After launching the model, please click the step called "Using the Macro Simulation" to view your questions.</p> 
<p><strong>Instructions for Macro Simulation</strong></p>
<p>Step 1 -- Click <strong>Start</strong> and let the simulation run until the time elapsed is at least 500.</p>
<p>Step 2 -- Click <strong>Reset</strong>. Increase the size of the opening to 9, and leave the concentration at 1. Run the simulation until it stops.</p>
<p>Step 3 -- Click <strong>Reset</strong>. Leave the size of the opening at 9, and increase the concentration to 5. Run the simulation until it stops.</p>

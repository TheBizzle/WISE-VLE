Love, anger, shyness, boredom, etc.  I'd have to make some more variables and lots more methods.</response><response name="Javier N.">I'd implement something where if the pet ate too much it would die (or explode maybe).  So, you would have to feed it just enough, not too much.  This would be another conditional in those methods, maybe using hunger which could go negative, and a message saying what happened.</response></cannedResponses></Brainstorm>

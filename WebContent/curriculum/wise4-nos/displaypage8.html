<p>Diffusion is essential to many life processes. It is the means through which oxygen moves from the air we breathe to the blood, and from the blood to the cells that need it. It is how some nutrients move from the digestive tract to the blood, and how carbon dioxide and other wastes move from the cells to the blood, then to the lungs or kidneys for removal. It is also how some substances move <em>within</em> cells.</p>
<p>Diffusion is more efficient when substances don't have far to travel and when the concentration gradient is steep. Diffusion within the body cells is efficient because they are so tiny. Also, substances produced in one part of a cell are often used in another part. As a result, there is always a steep gradient within the cell, with a higher concentration near the site of production and a lower concentration near the site of use. Diffusion into and out of cells is efficient because cell membranes are tiny and because various body processes interact to maintain steep gradients. For example, the heart is always pumping, so blood is always moving. In the lungs, blood that gains oxygen is continually replaced by blood that is low in oxygen. In capillaries throughout the body, blood that loses oxygen is continually replaced by oxygen-rich blood. Moreover, because cells continuously use oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, there is always more oxygen in the blood than in the cells and more carbon dioxide in the cells than in the blood. As a result, oxygen molecules continuously diffuse into cells, and carbon dioxide molecules continuously diffuse out, down their respective gradients.

<p><strong>Permeability</strong><br />
In order to enter or leave a cell, a substance must pass through the cell's membrane. When a substance can pass through a membrane, we say that the membrane is permeable to that substance. Permeability depends on the size and type of molecule and the structure of the membrane. Most cells have selectively permeable or semipermeable membranes, which means they allow only certain substances to pass through. Most cells of the human body are permeable for oxygen and carbon dioxide, but not for large molecules like starches, fats, and proteins.</p> 
<p>You can observe a semipermeable membrane by placing cornstarch and water in a plastic bag. Seal the bag and immerse it in a bowl of water. Add some iodine to the water in the bowl, then set the bowl someplace where it will not be disturbed. By the next day, the cornstarch will be dark blue, indicated that iodine molecules were able to pass through the bag and react with the cornstarch inside. The water in the bowl will not have changed, indicating that the  starch molecules were not able to pass through the bag and react with the iodine outside.</p> 
<p><strong>Entropy</strong><br />
Diffusion illustrates the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which basically states that systems tend toward higher entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness, so what the law means is that a closed system (i.e., one that is not subject to outside influences) will spontaneously become less and less organized over time until it reaches equilibrium. For example, when a drop of dye is added to water, all the dye molecules are initially clustered together, surrounded by water molecules. This is an organized arrangement because the dye and water are in separate areas. Over time, however, the system will becomes less and less organized, with the molecules spreading into the water area and water molecules spreading into the dye area until they reach equilibrium.</p> 
<p><strong>Active versus Passive Transport</strong><br />
Diffusion is a spontaneous process that results in the equal distribution of substances. However, some body processes require an unequal distribution of substances. For example, nerve impulses are transmitted through the movement of ions, which are atoms or molecules that have an electrical charge. At rest, a nerve cell has more potassium ions inside that outside and more sodium ions outside than inside, creating a slight negative charge. When the cell is stimulated, gates in the membrane open, allowing potassium to diffuse outward and sodium to diffuse inward. This changes the cell's charge from negative to positive, which transmits the impulse to the next area. To return to the resting state, sodium ions must move out of the cell and potassium ions must move in. Both kinds of ions must move <em>into</em> an area of greater concentration, which is analogous to swimming upstream. This requires energy, and the process used to achieve it is called active transport. Because diffusion occurs spontaneously and does not require energy, it is sometimes called passive transport.</p>

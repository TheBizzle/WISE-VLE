<p>Imagine you are baking cookies. You fill a cookie sheet and place it in the oven. The phone rings, and you go to the other room to answer it. You're so engrossed in your conversation that you don't hear the timer go off. Soon, you can smell the cookies starting to burn. You hang up, rush to the kitchen, and open the oven. The cookies are browner than you like, but they're not completely ruined.</p>
<p>How does the odor reach your nose in the other room?</p>
<p>Imagine you add milk to coffee or tea, but you don't stir. At first, most of the milk is concentrated in one area and the rest of the liquid is dark. As you watch, however, the colors gradually blend together until all the liquid is the same color.</p> 
<p>Why do the two liquids mix?</p>
<p>Both of these examples -- the odor spreading from the oven to your nose and the two liquids blending together -- illustrate the process of diffusion.</p>
<p>Diffusion processes occur in daily life, the earth around us, and in many important chemical and biological systems. For example, pollutants diffuse into the atmosphere and surface water from contaminant sources, carbon dioxide and oxygen diffuse across cellular membranes in living organisms, and reactants diffuse into catalyst pores causing increased chemical reaction rates. Diffusion thus represents a fundamental and critically important process involving random molecular movement of liquids and gases (and to some extent solids). It is very important that engineers and scientists understand the detailed dynamics of how and why diffusion occurs -- the topic of this activity.</p> 
<p><strong>Atoms, Molecules, and Motion</strong><br/>
According to the Molecular Theory of Matter, molecules are constantly moving. Unlike the molecules of solids, which are so tightly packed that they can only vibrate and spin in place, the molecules of liquids and gases are free to move much more easily. The movements of fluid molecules are random. This means that  the direction of a given molecule is impossible to predict. It is as likely to move one way as another.</p> 
<p>As a result of this random motion, fluid molecules tend to stir themselves. Molecules of the same kind tend to spread out evenly, and molecules of different kinds tend to mix together. When you add milk to coffee, for example, milk molecules tend to spread in to the coffee, and coffee molecules tend to spread into the milk. Thus, the random motion of molecules cases the two liquids to form one homogeneous mixture. </p>
<p>This process -- the spontaneous scattering or blending that occurs because of the continuous, random motion of fluid molecules -- is called <strong>diffusion</strong>. Imagine you add one drop of blue dye to a beaker of water. Initially, all the dye molecules are crowded together in one area, and the rest of the water is clear. Throughout the beaker, all the dye and water molecules are moving randomly, colliding with each other and with the inner surface of the beaker. However, because there are no dye molecules in the clear area, all the dye molecules will either stay in the blue area or move outward. As more and more dye molecules spread outward, some are likely to move back toward the blue area, but as long as there is more dye there than in the surrounding area, more dye molecules will move outward than inward. Similarly, because there are more water molecules in the clear area, more water molecules will move from clear to blue than from blue to clear. As long as there are more molecules of a substance in one area than another, more molecules of that substance will move away from that area then will move toward it.</p>

<p>Eventually, the dye and water molecules will spread evenly throughout the beaker, creating a uniformly light blue mixture. This situation is called <strong>equilibrium</strong>, because the distribution of molecules is balanced. Once equilibrium is reached, the molecules will continue to move, but their distribution will remain approximately the same. In other words, once molecules are evenly spread out, they will not gather back together in one area.</p> 
<p>The amount of substance per unit of another substance is called <strong>concentration</strong>. For example, if you dissolve 1 gram of salt into 100 ml of water, you create a 1% salt solution. If you dissolve 10 grams in 100 ml, you create a 10% salt solution. What may not be quite so obvious is that the 1% solution has a higher concentration of water than the 10% solution.</p> 
<p>During diffusion, the net pattern of flow is always from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Another way of describing this is to say that diffusion occurs <strong>down a concentration gradient</strong>. A concentration gradient exists whenever there is more of a substance in one area than other. The greater the difference in concentration, the steeper the gradient, and the steeper the gradient, the faster the rate of diffusion. Imagine you have two identical beakers containing equal volumes of room-temperature water. If you add 2 drops of dye to one beaker and 10 drops of dye to the other, the gradient will be steeper in the beaker with 10 drops, and the dye will spread faster. However, as a solution approaches equilibrium, the concentration gradient decreases and the rate of diffusion slows down. Thus, although the dye initially spreads faster in the 10-drop beaker, there is more dye to spread and, since the rate continues to decrease as it spreads, it may not actually reach equilibrium ahead of the 2-drop beaker.</p>

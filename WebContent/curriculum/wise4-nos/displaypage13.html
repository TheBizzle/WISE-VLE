<p>You will recall that heat is transferred by conduction, convection, and radiation. Mass, however, is transferred by <em>conduction</em> (called diffusion) and <em>convection</em> only, and there is no such thing as "mass radiation" (unless there is something Scotty knows that we don't want when he "beams" people to anywhere in space at the speed of light) (Figure 5). The rate of heat conduction in a direction <em>x</em> is proportional to the temperature gradient <em>dT/dx</em> in that direction and is expressed by <strong>Fourier's law of heat conduction</strong> as:</p>
<p><img src="http://wise.berkeley.edu/upload/26655/Qcond.jpg" alt="Fourier's law of heat conduction"/></p>
<p>where <em>k</em> is the thermal conductivity of the medium and <em>A</em> is the area normal to the direction of heat transfer.</p>

<p>Likewise, the rate of mass diffusion m of a chemical species <i>A</i> in a stationary medium in the direction <em>x</em> is proportional to the concentration gradient <em>dC/dx</em> in that direction and is expressed by <strong>Fick's law of diffusion</strong> (Figure 6):</p>
<p><img src="http://wise.berkeley.edu/upload/26656/daba.jpg" alt="Fick's law of diffusion."/></p>
<p>where <em>D<sub>AB</sub></em> is the diffusion coefficient (or <i>mass diffusivity</i>) of the species in the mixture and <em>C<sub>AB</sub></em> is the concentration of the species in the mixture at that location.</p>

<p>It can be shown that the differential equations for both heat conduction and mass diffusion are of the same form. Therefore, the solutions of mass diffusion equations can be obtained from the solutions of corresponding heat conduction equations for the same type of boundary conditions by simply switching the corresponding coefficients and variables.</p>

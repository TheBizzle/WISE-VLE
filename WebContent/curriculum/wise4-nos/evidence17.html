<h3>Mathematical Models</h3>
<p>
The basic idea of mathematical modeling is to find a mathematical relationship that behaves in the same way the system of interest does. (The system in this case can be other abstractions, as well as physical or biological phenomena.) For example, the increasing speed of a falling rock can be represented by the symbolic relation v = gt, where g has a fixed value. The model implies that the speed of fall (v) increases in proportion to the time of fall (t). A mathematical model makes it possible to predict what phenomena may be like in situations outside of those in which they have already been observedâ€”but only what they may be like. Often, it is fairly easy to find a mathematical model that fits a phenomenon over a small range of conditions (such as temperature or time), but it may not fit well over a wider range. Although v = gt does apply accurately to objects such as rocks falling (from rest) more than a few meters, it does not fit the phenomenon well if the object is a leaf (air drag limits its speed) or if the fall is a much larger distance (the drag increases, the force of gravity changes).

Mathematical models may include a set of rules and instructions that specifies precisely a series of steps to be taken, whether the steps are arithmetic, logical, or geometric. Sometimes even very simple rules and instructions can have consequences that are extremely difficult to predict without actually carrying out the steps. High-speed computers can explore what the consequences would be of carrying out very long or complicated instructions. For example, a nuclear power station can be designed to have detectors and alarms in all parts of the control system, but predicting what would happen under various complex circumstances can be very difficult. The mathematical models for all parts of the control system can be linked together to simulate how the system would operate under various conditions of failure.

What kind of model is most appropriate varies with the situation. If the underlying principles are poorly understood, or if the mathematics of known principles is very complicated, a physical model may be preferable; such has been the case, for example, with the turbulent flow of fluids. The increasing computational speed of computers makes mathematical modeling and the resulting graphic simulation suitable for more and more kinds of problems.

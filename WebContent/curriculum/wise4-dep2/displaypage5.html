<body><p>Heat has always been perceived to be something that produces a sensation of warmth, and one would think that heat would have been one of the first things understood by science.  But it was only in the middle of the nineteenth century that we developed an understanding of the nature of heat, thanks to the development of the kinetic theory, which treats molecules as tiny balls that are in motion and thus possess kinetic energy.  Under the kinetic theory, heat is defined as the random motion of atoms and molecules.</p> 
<p>Prior to the advent of the kinetic theory, the prevailing view of heat was based on the caloric theory proposed by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794).  The caloric theory asserts that heat is a fluid-like substance called caloric that is massless, colorless, odorless and tasteless, and can be poured from one body into another!  When caloric was added to a body, its temperature increased.  When a body could not contain any more caloric - much the same as when a glass of water cannot dissolve any more sugar - the body was said to be saturated with caloric.  This interpretation gave rise to the terms saturated liquid and saturated vapor that are still in use today.</p>

<p>The caloric theory came under attack soon after its introduction.  It maintained that heat is a substance that cannot be created or destroyed.  Yet it was known that heat could be generated indefinitely by rubbing one's hands together or running two pieces of wood together.  In 1778, the American Benjamin Thompson (also known as Count Rumford) showed that heat can be generated continuously through friction.  The validity of the caloric theory was also challenged by the careful experiments of Englishman James P. Joule who published a paper in 1843 that finally convinced the skeptics that heat was not a substance after all, thus putting the caloric theory to rest.</p>

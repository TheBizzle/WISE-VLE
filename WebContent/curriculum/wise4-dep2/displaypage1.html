<body><p>Now you'll explore a simulation of a simplified model of heat transfer. The picture below shows a screen shot of the simulation, which you'll open when you click on the next step.  You will see that we have represented three different materials (wood, metal and glass), with a light bulb that will provide heat energy.  After you select the material you're interested in and turn the light bulb on, you will see a pattern of red that moves along the bar from left to right.</p>

<p>When you click on the next step, a new window will open that has the simulation ready for you to experiment with. After you have opened it, please click on the following step (called "Using the macro heat simulation") to open the set of instructions and the notepad where you can add your reflections.</p>

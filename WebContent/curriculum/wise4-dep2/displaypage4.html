<body><p>Heat transfer is commonly encountered in engineering systems and other aspects of everyday life.  In fact, one does not have to go anywhere to see an application of heat transfer: The human body is constantly rejecting heat to its surroundings, and human comfort is closely tied to the rate of heat transfer.  We try to control this process by adjusting our clothing to the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Many ordinary household appliances are designed, in whole or in part, by using the principles of heat transfer.  Some examples include the electric or gas oven, home heating and air conditioning systems, refrigerators, hot water heaters, irons, and even computers and televisions.  Of course, energy-efficient homes are designed on the basis of minimizing heat loss in the winter and gain in the summer.  The optimal insulation thickness in the walls and roofs of houses, on hot water or steam pipes, or on water heaters is again determined on the basis of heat transfer analysis with economic consideration.</p>

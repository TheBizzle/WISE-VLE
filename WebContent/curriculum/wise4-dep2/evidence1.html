<body><p>All matter is composed of continually jiggling atoms or molecules. Whether the atoms and molecules combine to form solids, liquids or gases depends on how fast the molecules are moving. By virtue of their motion, the molecules or atoms in matter possess kinetic energy. The average kinetic energy of the individual particles is directly related to a property you can sense: how hot something is. Whenever something becomes warmer, we know that the kinetic energy of its particles increases. Strike a solid penny with a hammer and it becomes warm because the hammer's blow causes the atoms in the metal to jostle faster. Put a flame to a liquid and it too becomes warmer. Rapidly compress air in a tire pump and the air becomes warmer. When a solid, liquid, or gas gets warmer, its atoms or molecules move faster. The atoms or molecules have more kinetic energy. </p>

<p>The quantity that tells how warm or cold an object is with respect to some standard is called temperature. We express the temperature of matter by a number that corresponds to the degree of hotness on some chosen scale.</p>

<body><p>Now you will explore another simulation of heat, where you will see a more detailed view of a bar, with the light bulb out of sight below the bar, and the magnificatioon "zoomed in" so you can see individual molecules within the bar itself.</p>

<p><label for="figure1">Figure 1. Image of the micro heat simulation model.</label></p>
<p>As part of the model you will see buttons to allow you to heat or cool the bar</p>
<p>When you click on the next step, you will launch the simulation. You can follow the instructions found there. The following step, called "Using the micro heat simulation" will allow you to provide some observations about the model.</p>

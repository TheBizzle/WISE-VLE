<p>Let's review the differences between the elements and patterns in the two kinds of processes. First, remember the two kinds of processes: Emergent Processes like the crowd bottleneck or the schools of fish, and Direct Processes like the skyscraper construction and the pack of wolves hunting.</p>
<p>All four of these examples have one thing in common: they include many individual elements that interact to form a process. The way the two kinds of processes differ is in HOW those elements interact. In fact, to contrast these two types of processes more directly, let's use as examples two processes involving the same elements: workers building a skyscraper versus the same set of workers creating a bottleneck while rushing to go home at the end of the day (assuming that when the whistle blows at quitting time, they all head for the same exit gate of the building, resulting in a bottleneck). The main difference between the process of building a skyscraper (a direct process) and creating a bottleneck (an emergent process), is how the workers interact.</p>
<p>The workers' interactions in the skyscraper construction process differ from their interactions in the bottleneck process in several ways. <strong><em>We'll use italics</em></strong> to draw the contrasts - so whenever you see an italics word below, it is part of a key difference between emergent and direct processes, with regard to how the micro and macro levels are related:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, in building a skyscraper, each worker has <em>distinguishable</em> roles or interactions with the other workers, such as a foreman listening to the architect; a laborer taking orders from the foreman, and so on. But when the whistle blows at the end of the day - quitting time - those construction workers all head for the exit gate of the building, and it doesn't matter which worker has what role, because they are all <em>uniform</em> in how they interact to form the bottleneck, regardless of whether they are electricians, masons, or architects. Please note that by "uniform" we don't mean that the interactions of the workers are absolutely identical. Some workers may be coming from different floors than others. Some may even start out running while others start out walking (everyone ends up just shuffling!)By &#8220;uniform&#8221; we mean that they are all participating in the same kind of interactions, not identical ones.</li>
<li>Second, in the skyscraper construction process, each worker <em>is restricted</em> in terms of which workers or kind of workers that he or she can interact with. For example, the architect generally interacts mostly with the foremen, whereas the foremen interact with the carpenters and the electricians. In the bottleneck process, on the other hand, it doesnâ€™t matter who each worker runs into or shoves on his or her way to the gate - so a worker can interact with any other worker in an <em>unrestricted way</em>.</li>
<li>Third, in the skyscraper construction process there are <em>necessary time sequences</em> in the tasks the workers have to undertake. For example, the electricians obviously cannot install wiring until the walls have been constructed. In forming the bottleneck at the exit, however, all the construction workers can go into action <em>simultaneously</em>.</li>
<li>Fourth, and related to the previous point, the interactions of some elements within the construction process <em>depend on</em> the interactions of other elements. For example, the job of the electricians depends 
on the walls being prepared for wiring by the carpenters. In contrast, nobody's participation in the bottleneck depends on anyone else's. In creating the bottleneck, all the workers contribute to the process <em>independently</em> from all other workers.</li>
<li>Finally, when the skyscraper is completed, <em>the building process ends</em> and the workers stop working. In contrast, even once the bottleneck has been established, the workers <em>continue to interact</em>, pushing and shoving each other within the bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
<p>This table summarizes the differences between elements in the two kinds of processes:</p>

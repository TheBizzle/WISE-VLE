<body><p>Welcome to the lesson on direct and emergent processes!</p>
<p>This lesson will introduce you to a new way of thinking about certain concepts in engineering and science.  We'll discuss some ways to describe processes, and introduce two different kinds of processes that are important in engineering and science. Then you will take a look at some examples of concepts that are common in the engineering sciences, and hopefully see how a &#8220;system process view&#8221; can help you gain a deeper understanding.</p>

<p>Throughout the lesson, we have included questions designed to help you reflect on the material. We also include some computer animations that will illustrate some of the ideas. By developing an appreciation of these special kinds of processes, you may find it easier to understand some of the challenging topics in your future engineering science courses.</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughtful attention! Now, progress through the activities and steps in this project to continue. </p>

<p>Now consider the example of a school of fish moving about the ocean in search of food. Such schools as the one pictured above can be enormous, with thousands of individual fish. No single fish is in the lead, and the whole school swims together wherever it goes.</p>
<p>You could think of this as a kind of "crowd" like the one that formed the bottleneck at the exit doors - only in this case, there is no exit door that would cause a crowd (of fish) to form.  So why do fish form schools?  The reason is that fish benefit from being close to their neighbors is that there is "safety in numbers".  This means that if a predator comes toward a fish, but it is surrounded by dozens of other identical fish, then the chances of that one fish being snagged by the predator are much lower.</p>
<p>Even though "safety in numbers" is an effective means of protection for the fish, it is important to note that each fish does not know this. Each fish does not swim near another fish for the purpose of creating a school of fish for protection.  Instead, each fish just has an instinct to swim near another fish.  In fact, each fish doesn't care  which neighbor it is close to - as long as it is close to as many neighbors as possible.  When every fish feels this way (and they do - quite strongly!) then a school is born.  The school of fish circles through the ocean, looking for food and staying close knit.  But who leads the school? Nobody, really!  If a fish on the outside edge of the school veers off to the right (to avoid a predator or to go after some food), then that fish's neighbors veer off to keep close, and the fish next to them do the same, until suddenly the whole school is seen to veer off to the right. In this way, the <em>pattern</em> of fish "schooling" simply <em>emerges</em> from the interactions of all the individual fish.</p>

<p>If the fish schooling is an Emergent Process, then what is an element of this process? If you guessed: "A fish" - you're right! How do the elements interact?  Do they talk with their neighbors and agree when they should all turn one way or the other? Do they communicate about a predator fish that might be coming toward them from one side of the school?</p> 
<p>Thankfully, there is a more simple explanation. Each fish simply interacts <em>in the same way</em> with any other fish</em> that are nearby, no matter which fish those happen to be: to try to stay near those fish. The process <em>never really comes to an end</em>, as the school continues to move and each individual fish continues to follow that same rule of interaction. All fish in the school interact this way <em>at the same time</em>, and <em>do not care</em> what is happening with any other fish.</p>
<p>In the previous paragraph, we described the interactions, using <em>italics</em> for several phrases. These phrases were italicized because they capture the key features of how the elements interact within Emergent Processes.  Let's look back at them one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"any other fish"</em> means that interactions are not restricted to any specific kinds of elements. For example, in the skyscraper construction, electricians could only take their instructions from the foreman. Instead, any fish simply interacts blindly with whatever fish it happens to be next to.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Emergent Processes interact "in an unrestricted manner".</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"in the same way"</em> means that there is only one kind of interaction, in the pattern of schooling: to swim near another fish. However, having one kind of indistinguishable interaction does not mean that each interaction must be identical. For example, one fish can swim to the left to be near his buddy and another fish can swim to the right to be near her buddy.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Emergent Processes interact "in a uniform or indistinguishable manner".</strong></p></li> 
<li><em>"Never really comes to an end"</em> means that there is no beginning or ending to the interaction. Every fish continues to swim near another fish even though a school has already been formed.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Emergent Processes continue to "interact indefinitely" - even if the pattern of the process looks like it has come to an end.</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"at the same time"</em> means that all of these interactions are occurring simultaneously, with no particular order or sequence.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Emergent Processes interact "Simultaneously".</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"Do not care"</em> means that any individual element does not depend on any other element in performing its interactions.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Emergent Processes interact "Independently"</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you really understand Emergent Processes. Later on, we'll show you how this can help you understand some other concepts in engineering, besides fish schooling.  But for now, hopefully you see how these simple rules of interaction can explain a very interesting and complicated phenomenon, like why fish can stay in a school, even though no fish intended to form a school.</p>

<p>When your college classes end, what happens? You and all your classmates make a mad dash for the door as soon as the teacher dismisses you (if you're on the ball, your backpack is already packed and ready to go).  But at the door, you and your fellow students can't all fit through at once.  So, a bottleneck forms and there is a crowd at the door that seems as if nobody is moving at all!</p>

<p>This process is very different from that of the skyscraper, and will help us understand more sophisticated engineering processes in the steps below. We refer to this process as an <em>Emergent Process</em> because the pattern of the process emerges indirectly from interactions among all the elements. In the case of <em>Direct Process</em>, on the other hand, the pattern changes directly as a result of the interactions of some of the elements, such as the steel workers directly causing the skyscraper to get taller as they frame the building with more beams.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Elements</em></strong> in the crowd process described above are the individual students who are all trying to leave the room. Notice several features about this crowding process. First, all the students are behaving more-or-less the same way, which is to run toward the door at about the same speed, as each student is about the same age and size, and has the same goal of just exiting the room. In contrast, in building a skyscraper, each type of worker had a different set of behaviors: some install wirings and others lay beams. Second, the students are all acting and interacting independently of one another simultaneously: they are all just trying to move forward toward the door, and in doing so, they may bump into and push other students. In contrast, in building a skyscraper, the masons must lay the foundation before steel workers can frame the building.  So these activities must be carried out sequentially. Third, no single student's running or pushing another student resulted in a jam at the door. That is, no single student is telling any other student what to do, and the students aren't really pushing each other to result in the jam. The jam is caused by all the students simultaneously trying to run toward the door.  In contrast, in a skyscraper, if the building fails in some way, we might point to a single worker, perhaps the architect as the person responsible for the problem.  Fourth, all the students want to do is run to the door to get out of school.  They were not planning to create a jam at the door.  So the crowding occurring at the door (the jam) occurred despite the fact that no one intended it to occur.  In contrast, all the workers wanted to build a skyscraper.</p>
<p>Finally, each of the students continues this effort to move forward and pushing into another student despite the fact that a jam has formed and not everyone can get through the door at once.</p>
<p>Notice that the bottleneck (or the pattern of the crowding) simply emerges as a result of the efforts of all the elements. Each person engages in the same behavior of trying to move forward to the door, eventually bumping into other students. No single student creates the obstacle, but somehow the fact that all students are pushing forward in this way allows the overall pattern of a bottleneck to emerge.</p>
<p>This kind of process is called an <em><strong>Emergent Process</strong></em> and is very different from the <em><strong>Direct Process</strong></em> that we described earlier (building a skyscraper). In <em><strong>Emergent Processes</strong></em>, the interactions of the elements do not directly cause the pattern to occur. Instead, the pattern of the process emerges over time with no clear cause-and-effect relationships  between the pattern and its elements. In the remainder of this lesson, we will show you how such <em><strong>Emergent Processes</strong></em> are common in engineering, which could help you understand some notoriously challenging enginnering topics!</p>

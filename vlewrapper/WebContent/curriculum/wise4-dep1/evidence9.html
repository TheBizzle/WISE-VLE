<p>Now consider the example of wolves hunting in a pack. Wolves are complex social animals who interact with other members of their pack in complex ways.  There are leaders and followers, mothers and children, and a rather complex social life that occurs within the pack. But one of the most interesting thing that wolves do is to hunt their prey. They don't hunt every day, and sometimes they even go for days without eating. But when they do hunt, they kill an animal large enough for the whole pack to eat its fill.</p>
<p>The wolf hunt is a fascinating process, where individual wolves interact to pursue complex strategies.  Some members of the pack will divert the attention of the prey, while others will cut off possible escape routes.  Others give chase, and when one wolf becomes exhausted another takes up pursuit with fresh legs. The process of the hunt is complete when the prey has been taken down.</p>

<p>Wolves hunting in a pack has the same visual pattern as fish swimming in a school. Both of them involve a large number of animals and fish forming a group-like pattern. They both also serve the same purpose: "safety and power in numbers". However, wolves hunting in a pack and fish swimming in a school are very different processes.   Wolves hunting in a pack is a <em>Direct Process,</em> more like the construction workers building a skyscraper, whereas fish schooling is more like the crowd forming a bottleneck. Let's see why.</p>
<p>It's easy to guess that one of the elements in this process is the individual wolf, but now it becomes a little more tricky: "which wolf is which"becomes an important question. Just like with the skyscraper construction workers, there are <em>many different kinds of interactions</em> that occur between the wolves when they are hunting, and which interaction you see <em>depends on which wolf</em> you are observing. The leader wolf will have very different kinds of interactions than some of the junior wolves; male wolves play a different role than females, and so on. Within the hunt itself, there are chasers, decoys, and killers, and these interactions happen in a very <em>specific sequence</em>.  Interactions between the different animals <em>affect other interactions</em> too. For example, if the animal being hunted turns around to fight, then the wolves might actually run away! Finally, the process of wolves hunting is something that <em>comes to a completion</em> once the prey has been taken down, or gets away.</p>
<p>As you can see, this kind of Direct Process is probably much more common in nature and in every day life. It is important to understand it, in terms of the elements and interactions, so that you can see the differences between Direct and Emergent processes. Once again, the italics in the paragraph above help us list the important features of Direct Processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"many different kinds of interactions"</em> means that within the process of wolves hunting, you can see distinguishable activities from different animals that contribute to the overall pattern of the hunt.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Direct Processes can have various "distinguishable kinds of interactions".</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"depends on which wolf"</em> means that certain wolves will play certain roles and restrict their interaction to certain other wolves. For example, chaser wolves do not interact with decoy wolves.
<p><strong>-- Thus, elements in Direct Processes are restricted to with whom they can interact.</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"specific sequence"</em> means that some interactions cannot occur before others. For example, the kill would not occur before the chase.
<p><strong>-- Thus, interactions within Direct Processes occur in a specific sequence.</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"affect other interactions"</em> means that the results of one interaction can affect another one, or even prevent it.  For example, if the prey escapes during the "chase" interaction, then the "kill" interaction will not occur.
<p><strong>-- Thus, interactions in Direct Processes depend on other interactions.</strong></p></li>
<li><em>"comes to a completion"</em> means just what it says:  At a certain point, an observer will be able to say with certainty that the hunt process is over. When that happens, the wolves will stop interacting.
<p><strong>-- Thus, interactions in Direct Processes can terminate.</strong></p></li>
</ul> 
<p>This may seem like a little too much detail about something as ordinary as a direct process, but if you can understand it in terms of the elements and interactions, this will allow you to compare Direct Processes with Emergent Processes, leading you to better understanding of some very interesting examples we will see later on.</p>

<p>This lesson will help you learn about two different kinds of processes that will help you in future engineering classes.  Before we get into any specific examples, however, lets define a <em>process</em>:</p>
<p>An event that happens over a period of time that includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>pattern</em> that can be seen and described</li>
<li>How the pattern <em>behaves</em> and <em>changes</em> under different conditions</li>
<li><em>Elements</em> that may not be visible, but which help to make up the process</li>
<li><em>Interactions</em> of the elements</li>
<li>A <em>mechanism</em> that explains how the elements  interact to produce the pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>Familiar examples of processes include riding a bicycle, constructing a skyscraper, or water evaporating from the pavement after it rains. Other examples of processes may not be so familiar: thunder in a rainstorm, baseball games, a pack of wolves hunting, or students creating a bottleneck as they race to get out of class!</p>
<p>In the next step of this project, we will continue to explore two very different processes, using the examples of: 1) building a skyscraper; and 2) crowds forming a bottleneck at the exit of a building. We will show how the definition above can help us understand why these two processes are fundamentally different, in terms of their elements, interactions of the elements, and how the interactions of the elements produce the pattern  (i.e., mechanisms).</p>

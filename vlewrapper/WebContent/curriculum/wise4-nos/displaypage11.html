<p>We have spent a considerable amount of time looking at heat transfer, and we could spend just as much time (perhaps more) studying mass transfer. However, the mechanisms of heat and mass transfer are analogous to each other,  and thus we can develop an understanding of mass transfer in a short time with little effort simply by drawing <em>parallels</em> between heat and mass transfer.  Establishing those "bridges" between the two seemingly unrelated areas will make it possible to use our heat transfer knowledge to solve mass transfer problems. Alternatively, gaining a working knowledge of mass transfer will help us to better understand the heat transfer process thinking of heat as a massless substance as they did in the 19th century. The short-lived caloric theory of heat is the origin of most heat transfer terminology used today and served its purpose well until it was replaced by the kinetic theory. Mass is, in essence, energy since mass and energy can be converted to each other according to Einstein's formula <em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em> where <em>c</em> is the speed of light. Therefore, we can look at mass and heat as two different forms of energy and exploit this advantage without going overboard.</p>

<p>It is a common observation that whenever there in an imbalance of a commodity in a medium, the nature tends to redistribute it until a "balance" or "equality" is established. This tendency is often referred to as the driving force, which is the mechanism behind many naturally occurring transport phenomena.</p>
<p>If we define the amount of a commodity per until volume as the concentration of that commodity, we can say that the flow of a commodity is always in the direction of decreasing concentration; that is, from the regions of high concentration to the region of low concentration (Figure 1): </p>

<p>The commodity simply creeps away during redistribution, and thus the flow is a diffusion process. The rate of flow of the commodity is proportional to the concentration gradient dC/dx, which is the change in the concentration C per unit length in the direction of the flow x, and the area A normal to the direction of flow and is expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="http://wise-dev.berkeley.edu/upload/26655/flowrate.jpg" alt="Rate of flow equation 1"/></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><img src="http://wise-dev.berkeley.edu/upload/26655/Q=kdiff.jpg" alt="Rate of flow equation 2"/></p>
<p>Here the proportionality constant <em>k</em><sub>diff</sub> is the diffusion coefficient of the medium, which is a measure of how fast a commodity diffuses in the medium, and the negative sign is added to make the flow in the positive direction a positive quantity (note that dC/dx is a negative quantity since concentration decreases in the flow direction). You may recall that Fourier's law of heat conduction, Ohm's law of electrical conduction, and Newton's law of viscosity are all in the form of Equation 1.</p>
<p>To understand he diffusion process better, consider a tank that is divided into two equal parts by a partition. Initially, the left half of the tank contains nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas while the right half contains air (about 21 percent oxygen O<sub>2</sub> and 79 percent nitrogen N<sub>2</sub>) at the same temperature and pressure. The  O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>molecules are indicated by dark and light circles, respectively. When the partition is removed, we know that N<sub>2</sub> molecules will start diffusing into the air while the O<sub>2</sub> molecules diffuse into the N<sub>2</sub>, as shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p><label for="figure2">Figure 2. A tank that contains N<sub>2</sub> and air in its two compartments, and the diffusion of N<sub>2</sub> into the air when the partition is removed.</label></p>
<p>If we wait long enough, we will have a homogeneous mixture of N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in the tank. This mass diffusion process can be explained by considering an imaginary plane indicated by the dashed line in the figure as follows: Gas molecules move randomly, and thus the probability of a molecule moving to the right or to the let is the same. Consequently, half of the molecules on one side of the dashed line at any given moment will move on the other side. Since the concentration of N<sub>2</sub> is greater on the left side than it is on the right side, more N<sub>2</sub>molecules will move toward the right than toward the left, resulting in a new flow of N<sub>2</sub> toward the right. As a result, N<sub>2</sub> is said to be <em>transferred</em> to the right. A similar argument can be given for O<sub>2</sub> being transferred to the left. The process continues until uniform concentrations of N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> are established throughout the tank so that the number of N<sub>2</sub> (or O<sub>2</sub>) molecules moving to the right equals the number moving to the left, resulting in zero net transfer of N<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> across an imaginary plane.</p> 
<p>The molecules in a gas mixture continually collide with each other, and the diffusion process is strongly influenced by this collision process. The collision of like molecules is of little consequence since both molecules are identical and it makes no difference which molecules crosses a certain plane. The collisions of unlike molecules, however, influence the rate of diffusion since unlike molecules may have different masses and thus different momentums, and thus the diffusion process will be dominated by the heavier molecules. The diffusion coefficients and thus diffusion rates of gases depend strongly on <em>temperature</em> since the temperature is a measure of the average velocity of gas molecules. Therefore, the diffusion rates will be higher at higher temperatures.</p> 
<p>Mass transfer can also occur in liquids and solids as well as in gases. For example, a cup of water left in a room will eventually evaporate as a result of water molecules diffusing into the air <em>(liquid-to-gas mass transfer)</em>. A piece of solid CO<sub>2</sub> (dry ice) will also get smaller and smaller in time as the CO<sub>2</sub>molecules diffuse into the air <em>(solid-to-gas mass transfer)</em>. A spoon of sugar in a cup of coffee will eventually move up and sweeten the coffee although the sugar molecules are much heavier than the water molecules, and the molecules of a colored pencil inserted into a glass of water will diffuse into the water as evidenced by the gradual spread of color in the water <em>(solid-to-liquid mass transfer)</em>. Of course, the mass transfer can also occur from a gas to a liquid or solid if the concentration of the species is higher in the gas phase. For example, a small fraction of O<sub>2</sub> in the air diffuses into the water and meets the oxygen needs of marine animals. The diffusion of carbon into iron during case-hardening, doping of semiconductors for transistors, an d the migration of doped molecules in semiconductors for transistors, and the migration of doped molecules in semiconductors at high temperature are examples of solid-to-solid diffusion processes (Figure 3):</p>

<p>Another factor that influences the diffusion process is the <em>molecular spacing</em>. The larger the spacing, in general, the higher the diffusion rate. Therefore, the diffusion rates are typically much higher in gases than they are in liquids and much higher in liquids than in solids. Diffusion coefficients in gas mixtures are a few orders of magnitude larger than these of liquid or solid solutions.</p>

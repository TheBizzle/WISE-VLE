<h2> Welcome to the lesson on science processes!</p>
</b></i></h2>
<p>
Have you ever wondered about volcanoes?  Sharks?  Been inspired by the rainforest, the ocean or other natural wonders?  People who make a career of studying these or other interesting topics often become scientists.  Have YOU ever considered becoming an archaeologist? An astronaut?

In this activity, youâ€™ll be reading about scientists and some of the ideas that are important to the way scientists work.  Understanding these ideas can even help you think about how current science investigations have come about and how they might be resolved.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the activity, we have included questions to help you reflect on what you have learned. We also include some computer animations that will help illustrate some of the ideas.  The goal of this lesson is to help you gain some appreciation of certain kinds of processes in science, that should help you succeed in later science courses.

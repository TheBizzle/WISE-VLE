<h3>Physical Models</h3>
<p>
The most familiar meaning of the term "model" is the physical modelâ€”an actual device or process that behaves enough like the phenomenon being modeled that we can hope to learn something from it. Typically, a physical model is easier to work with than what it represents because it is smaller in size, less expensive in terms of materials, or shorter in duration.
</p>
<p>
Experiments in which variables are closely controlled can be done on a physical model in the hope that its response will be like that of the full-scale phenomenon. For example, a scale model of an airplane can be used in a wind tunnel to investigate the effects of different wing shapes. Human biological processes can be modeled by using laboratory animals or cultures in test tubes to test medical treatments for possible use on people. Social processes too can be modeled, as when a new method of instruction is tried out in a single classroom rather than in a whole school system. But the scaling need not always be toward smaller and cheaper. Microscopic phenomena such as molecular configurations may require much larger models that can be measured and manipulated by hand.
</p>
<p>
A model can be scaled in time as well as in size and materials. Something may take so inconveniently long to occur that we observe only a segment of it. For example, we may want to know what people will remember years later of what they have been taught in a school course, but we settle for testing them only a week later. Short-run models may attempt to compress long-term effects by increasing the rates at which events occur. One example is genetic experimentation on organisms such as bacteria, flies, and mice that have large numbers of generations in a relatively short time span. Another important example is giving massive doses of chemicals to laboratory animals to try to get in a short time the effect that smaller doses would produce over a long time. A mechanical example is the destructive testing of products, using machines to simulate in hours the wear on, say, shoes or weapons that would occur over years in normal use. On the other hand, very rapid phenomena may require slowed-down models, such as slow-motion depiction of the motion of birds, dancers, or colliding cars.
</p>
<p>
The behavior of a physical model cannot be expected ever to represent the full-scale phenomenon with complete accuracy, not even in the limited set of characteristics being studied. If a model boat is very small, the way water flows past it will be significantly different from a real ocean and boat; if only one class in a school uses a new method, the specialness of it may make it more successful than the method would be if it were commonplace; large doses of a drug may have different kinds of effects (even killing instead of curing), not just quicker effects. The inappropriateness of a model may be related to such factors as changes in scale or the presence of qualitative differences that are not taken into account in the model (for example, rats may be sensitive to drugs that people are not, and vice versa).

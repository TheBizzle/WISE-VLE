<h3>SCALE</h3>
<p>
The ranges of magnitudes in our universe—sizes, durations, speeds, and so on—are immense. Many of the discoveries of physical science are virtually incomprehensible to us because they involve phenomena on scales far removed from human experience. We can measure, say, the speed of light, the distance to the nearest stars, the number of stars in the galaxy, and the age of the sun, but these magnitudes are far greater than we can comprehend intuitively. In the other direction, we can determine the size of atoms, their vast numbers, and how quickly interactions among them occur, but these extremes also exceed our powers of intuitive comprehension. Our limited perceptions and information-processing capacities simply cannot handle the whole range. Nevertheless, we can represent such magnitudes in abstract mathematical terms (for example, billions of billions) and seek relationships among them that make sense.

Large changes in scale typically are accompanied by changes in the kind of phenomena that occur. For instance, on a familiar human scale, a small puff of gas emitted from an orbiting satellite dissipates into space; on an astronomical scale, a gas cloud in space with enough mass is pulled together by mutual gravitational forces into a hot ball that ignites nuclear fusion and becomes a star. On a human scale, substances and energy are endlessly divisible; on an atomic scale, matter cannot be divided and still keep its identity, and energy can change only by discrete jumps. The distance around a tree is much greater for a small insect than for a squirrel—in that on the scale of the insect's size there are many hills and valleys to traverse, whereas for the squirrel there are none.

Even within realms of space and time that are directly familiar to us, scale plays an important role. Buildings, animals, and social organizations cannot be made significantly larger or smaller without experiencing fundamental changes in their structure or behavior. For example, it is not possible to make a forty-story building of precisely the same design and materials commonly used for a four-story building because (among other things) it would collapse under its own weight. As objects increase in size, their volume increases faster than their surface area. Properties that depend on volume, such as capacity and weight, therefore change out of proportion to properties that depend on area, such as strength of supports or surface activity. For example, a substance dissolves much more quickly when it is finely ground than when it is in a lump because the ratio of surface area to volume is much greater. A microorganism can exchange substances with its environment directly through its surface, whereas a larger organism requires specialized, highly branched surfaces (such as in lungs, blood vessels, and roots).

Internal connections also show a strong scale effect. The number of possible pairs of things (for example, friendships or telephone connections) increases approximately as the square of the number of things. Thus, a community ten times as large will have approximately a hundred times as many possible telephone connections between residents. More generally, a city is not simply a large village, since almost everything that characterizes a city—services, work patterns, methods of governance—is necessarily different from, not just larger than, that in a village. As the magnitude increases, eventually we must resort to summary characteristics, such as averages over very large numbers of atoms or instants of time, or descriptions of typical examples.

<p>The driving force for heat transfer is the <em>temperature difference</em>. In contrast, the driving force for mass transfer is the <em>concentration difference</em>. We can view temperature as a measure of "heat concentration", and thus a high temperature region as one that has a high heat concentration (Figure 4). Therefore, both heat and mass are transferred from the more concentrated regions to the less concentrated ones. If there is no temperature difference between the two regions, then there is no heat transfer. Likewise, if there is no difference between the concentrations of a species at different parts of a medium, there will be no mass transfer.</p>

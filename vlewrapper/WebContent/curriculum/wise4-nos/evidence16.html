<h3>Conceptual Models</h3>
<p>
One way to give an unfamiliar thing meaning is to liken it to some familiar thing—that is, to use metaphor or analogy. Thus, automobiles were first called horseless carriages. Living "cells" were so called because in plants they seemed to be lined up in rows like rooms in a monastery; an electric "current" was an analogy to a flow of water; the electrons in atoms were said to be arranged around the nucleus in "shells." In each case, the metaphor or analogy is based on some attributes of similarity—but only some. Living cells do not have doors; electric currents are not wet; and electron shells do not have hard surfaces. So we can be misled, as well as assisted, by metaphor or analogy, depending on whether inappropriate aspects of likeness are inferred along with the appropriate aspects. For example, the metaphor for the repeated branching of species in the "tree of evolution" may incline one to think not just of branching but also of upward progress; the metaphor of a bush, on the other hand, suggests that the branching of evolution produces great diversity in all directions, without a preferred direction that constitutes progress. If some phenomenon is very unlike our ordinary experience, such as quantum phenomena on an atomic scale, there may be no single familiar thing to which we can liken it.

Like any model, a conceptual model may have only limited usefulness. On the one hand, it may be too simple. For example, it is useful to think of molecules of a gas as tiny elastic balls that are endlessly moving about, bouncing off one another; to accommodate other phenomena, however, such a model has to be greatly modified to include moving parts within each ball. On the other hand, a model may be too complex for practical use. The accuracy of models of complex systems such as global population, weather, and food distribution is limited by the large number of interacting variables that need to be dealt with simultaneously. Or, an abstract model may fit observations very well, but have no intuitive meaning. In modeling the behavior of molecules, for instance, we have to rely on a mathematical description that may not evoke any associated mental picture. Any model may have some irrelevant features that intrude on our use of it. For example, because of their high visibility and status, athletes and entertainers may be taken as role models by children not only in the aspects in which they excel but also in irrelevant—and perhaps distinctly less than ideal—aspects.

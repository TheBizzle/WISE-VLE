<p>To this point we have restricted our attention to heat transfer problems that did not involve any mass transfer. However, many significant heat transfer problems encountered in practice involve mass transfer. For example, about one-third of the heat loss from a resting person is due to the evaporation. It turns out that mass transfer is analogous to heat transfer in many respects, and there is close resemblance between the heat and mass transfer relations. In this section we discuss the mass transfer mechanisms and develop relations for the mass transfer rate for some situations commonly encountered in practice.</p>
<p>Distinction should be made between mass transfer and the bulk fluid motion (or fluid flow) that occurs on a macroscopic level as a fluid is transported from one location to another. Mass transfer requires the presence of two regions at different chemical compositions, and mass transfer refers to the movement of a chemical species from a high concentration region toward a lower concentration one relative to the other chemical species present in the medium. The primary driving force for fluid flow is the pressure difference, whereas for mass transfer it is the concentration difference. Therefore, we do not speak of mass transfer in a homogeneous medium.</p> 
<p>We begin this section by pointing out numerous analogies between heat and mass transfer and draw several parallels between them. We then discuss boundary conditions associated with mass transfer and one-dimensional steady and transient mass diffusion. Following a discussion of mass transfer in a moving medium, we close this section by considering convection mass transfer and simultaneous heat and mass transfer.</p>

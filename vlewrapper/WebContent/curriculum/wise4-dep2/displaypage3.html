<body><p>We all know from experience that a cold canned drink left in a room warms up and a warm drink left in the same room will cool down.  This is accomplished by the transfer of energy from the warm media to the cold one, and always stops when the two mediums reach the same temperature.  Note: "Medium" here means some substance or surrounding, such as a solid, liquid or gas.  For example, heat may be transferred from the medium of a hot air (an oven) into a solid medium (a potato).</p> 
<p>You will recall from thermodynamics that energy exists in various forms.  In this section, we are concerned primarily with heat: the form of energy that can be transferred from one system to another as a result of temperature difference.  The science that deals with the determination of the rates of such energy transfer is called heat transfer.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why we need to undertake a detailed study of heat transfer.  After all, we can determine the amount of heat energy transferred form one system to another using a thermodynamic analysis alone.  The reason is that thermodynamics is concerned with the amount of heat transfer as a system moves from one equilibrium state to another, but gives no indication about how long that process would take.  A thermodynamic analysis simply tells us how much heat must be transferred in the process in order to satisfy the conservation of energy process.</p>
<p>In practice, however, we are often more concerned about the rate of heat transfer than we are about the amount of it.  For example, we can determine the amount of heat transferred from a thermos bottle as the coffee inside of it cools from 90 degrees Celsius to 80 degrees Celsius by a thermodynamic analysis alone.  But a typical designer of a thermos is primarily interested in how long it will take before the hot coffee cools down to 80 degrees, and a thermodynamic analysis cannot address this question.  Determining the rates of heat transfer to or from a system and thus the times for cooling or heating to occur is the subject of heat transfer.</p>

<p>Thermodynamics deals with equilibrium states and changes from one equilibrium state to another.  Heat transfer, on the other hand, deals with systems that lack equilibrium.  Thus, heat transfer is a non-equilibrium phenomenon.</p>
<p>The basic requirement for heat transfer is the presence of a temperature difference within the system.  There can be no net heat transfer between two media that are at the same temperature.  Thus, the temperature difference is the driving force for heat transfer, just as the voltage difference is the driving force for electric current flow and pressure difference is the driving force for fluid flow.  The rate of heat transfer in a certain direction depends on the magnitude of the temperature gradient (the temperature difference per unit distance) along that direction.  The larger the temperature gradient, the higher the rate of heat transfer.</p>

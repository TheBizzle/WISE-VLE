<body><p>On the scale commonly used in laboratories, the number 0 is assigned to the temperature at which water freezes and the number 100 to the temperature at which water boils (at standard atmospheric pressure).</p>
<p>In the United States, the number 32 is assigned to the temperature at which water freezes, and the number 212 is assigned to the temperature at which water boils. Such a scale makes up a Fahrenheit thermometer, named after its illustrious originator, the German physicist D. G. Fahrenheit (1686-1736).</p>

<p>Temperature is related to the random motion of the molecules in a substance. More specifically, it is proportional to the average kinetic energy of molecular translational motion (that is, molecular motion along a straight or curved path). It is important to understand that temperature is not a measure of the total kinetic energy of molecules in a substance. For example, there is twice as much molecular kinetic energy in 2 liters of boiling water as in 1 liter of boiling water - but the temperature of both amounts of water are the same because the average kinetic energy per molecule in each is the same.</p>

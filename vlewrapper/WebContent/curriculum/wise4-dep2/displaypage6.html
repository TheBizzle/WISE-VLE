<body><p>Energy can exist in numerous forms, such as thermal, mechanical, kinetic, potential, electrical, magnetic, chemical or nuclear.  The sum of all these types of energy within a system is known as the total Energy, E. The forms of energy related to the molecular structure of the system and the degree of the molecular activity are referred to as the microscopic energy. The sum of all forms of microscopic energy is called the internal energy of the system.</p>
<p>Internal energy may be viewed as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all the molecules.  The portion of the internal energy of a system that is associated with the kinetic energy of its molecules is called the sensible energy or, the sensible heat. The temperature of the system is proportional to the average velocity and the degree of activity of the molecules.  Thus, at higher temperatures, the molecules will possess higher kinetic energy and as a result the system will have a higher internal energy.</p>
<p>The internal energy is also associated with the forces between molecules within the system, known as the intermolecular forces. These are the forces that bind molecules to each other, and are stronger in solids than in liquids or gases, as one might expect.  If sufficient energy is added to the molecules of a solid or liquid, they will overcome these intermolecular forces and simply break away from one another, turning the system into a gas.  This is a phase change process, and because of this added energy a system in the gas phase is at a higher internal energy than the same system would be if it was in a liquid or solid phase. The internal energy associated with the phase of a system is called latent energy or latent heat.</p>
<p>What about the energy stored in the bonds within a molecule? Typically, changes due to heating and cooling, even if they involve phase change, do not entail actual changes to the chemical composition of the system.  In other words, molecules themselves are not typically broken apart.  The internal energy associated with the atomic bonds in a molecule is called the chemical (or bond) energy, whereas the internal energy associated with the bonds within the nucleus itself is called the nuclear energy. Chemical or nuclear energies are absorbed or released within chemical or nuclear reactions, respectively.</p>

<body><p>If you touch a hot stove, energy enters your hand because the stove is warmer than your hand. When you touch a piece of ice, on the other hand, energy passes out of your hand and into the colder ice. The direction of spontaneous energy transfer is always from a warmer thing to a neighboring cooler thing. The energy transferred from one thing to another because of a temperature difference between the things is called heat.</p>

<p>It is important to point out that matter does not contain heat. Matter contains molecular kinetic energy and possibly potential energy, not heat. Heat is energy in transit from a body of higher temperature to one of lower temperature. Once transferred, the energy ceases to be heat.</p>
<p>Internal energy is the grand total of all energies inside a substance. In addition to the translational kinetic energy of jostling atoms in a substance, there is energy in other forms. There is rotational kinetic energy of molecules and kinetic energy due to internal movements of atoms within molecules. There is also potential energy due to the forces between molecules. So a substance does not contain heat, it contains internal energy.</p>
<p>When a substance absorbs or gives off heat, internal energy in the substance changes. Thus, as a substance absorbs heat, this energy may or may not make the molecules or atoms jostle faster. In some cases, as when ice is melting, a substance absorbs heat without an increase in molecular kinetic energy. The substance undergoes a change of phase.</p>
<p>For things in thermal contact, heat flow is from the substance at a higher temperature to a substance at a lower temperature, but not necessarily a flow from a substance with more internal energy to a substance with less internal energy. There is more internal energy in a bowl of warm water than there is in a red-hot thumbtack; if the tack is immersed in the water, heat flow is not from the warm water to the tack. Instead, heat flow is from the hot tack to the cooler water. Heat never flows from a low-temperature substance into a higher-temperature substance without external work being done on the system.</p>
<p>How much heat flows depends not only on the temperature differences between substances but on the amount of material as well. For example, a barrelfull of hot water will transfer more heat to a cooler substance than a cupful of water at the same temperature. There is more internal energy in the larger amount of water.</p>
<p>Heat transfers from warmer to cooler things. If several objects with different temperatures are in contact, those that are warm become cooler and those that are cool become warmer. They tend to reach a common temperature. This equalizing of temperature can occur in three ways: conduction, convection, and radiation.</p>

<body><p>In daily life, we frequently refer to the sensible and latent forms of internal energy as heat, and often refer to the "heat content" of objects.  In thermodynamics, however, those forms of energy are usually referred to as thermal energy in order to prevent confusion with the term heat transfer.</p>
<p>The term heat and associated phrases like heat flow, heat rejection and absorption, heat gain, heat loss, heat storage, electrical heating, body heat and heat source are used commonly today, and it unlikely that we would replace the word heat in those phrases with the term thermal energy. These phrases are deeply rooted in our vocabulary and are used by ordinary citizens as well as scientists and engineers.  For example, the phrase body heat is used very commonly in place of the more accurate expression thermal energy content of the body. Likewise, heat flow is used to mean transfer of thermal energy - and not the flow of some fluid-like substance called "heat". However, the latter incorrect version, based on the 18th century caloric theory is the origin of all such expressions. Similarly, the transfer of heat into a system is frequently referred to as heat addition and the transfer of heat out of a system as heat rejection.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are thermodynamic reasons for being so reluctant to replace the word heat with the more accurate term thermal energy. After all, it takes less time to say, write, and comprehend heat than thermal energy! Thus, keeping in line with current practice, this text will refer to the thermal energy as heat and the transfer of thermal energy as heat flow or heat transfer.</p>

<body><p>Hold one end of an iron nail in a flame. It will quickly become too hot to hold. The heat enters the metal nail at the end that is kept in the flame and the heat is transmitted along the nail's whole length. The transmission of heat in this manner is called conduction. The fire causes the molecules at the heated end of the nail to move more rapidly. Because of their increased motion, these molecules and free electrons collide with their neighbors, and so on. This bumping process continues until the increased motion has been transmitted to all the molecules and the entire body has become hot. Heat conduction occurs by electron and molecular collisions.</p>
<p>How well a solid object conducts heat depends on the bonding of its molecular structure. Solids whose molecules have one or more "loose" outer electrons conduct heat (and electricity) well. Metals have the "loosest" outer electrons and are the best conductors of heat and electricity for this reason. Silver is the best, copper is next, and, among the common metals, aluminum and then iron are next in order. Wool, wood, straw, paper, cork, and Styrofoam are poor conductors of heat. The outer electrons in the molecules of these materials are firmly attached. Poor conductors are called insulators.</p>
<p>Because wood is a good insulator it is used for handles of cookware. Even when it is hot, you can quickly grasp the wooden handle of a pot with your bare hand and remove the pot from a hot oven without harm. An iron handle of the same temperature would surely burn your hand.</p>

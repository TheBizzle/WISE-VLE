  <p id="audio3">Constructor bots like toys just as much as humans.  One of their favorite toys is a handheld electronic device within which a virtual pet "lives". This pet has <em>moods</em>, such as happiness or pain, and shows these mood through an image and a message on a screen.  The owner of the toy can make the pet <em>behave</em> in certain ways.  And, often, when the pet does something, its mood changes.</p>

  <p id="audio4">Cam is a young Constructor bot, fresh off the assembly line.  So, like you, she's just learning to program in Java.  Cam will be writing a Java program that acts like a fully working Virtual Pet toy &mdash one inside a computer.  The toy will be better than any she can buy, though, because she gets to customize the actions and reactions of the virtual pet.</p>
